# Pylash Engine
---------------

**Latest Version: 1.1.0**

`Pylash` is a game engine for `python` which imitates some classes and functions in `flash`. We develop `pylash` with `Python3` and the GUI engine of `pylash` is `PyQt4`. Many classes which are almost from `flash` such as `Sprite`, `BitmapData`, `Bitmap`, `TextField`, `Loader` and `Graphics` will be found in `pylash`.
